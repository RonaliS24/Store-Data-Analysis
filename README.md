# Store-Data-Analysis
## Description
This is my first Data Analysis Dashboard Project on Store Sales Analysis for the year 2022, developed entirely in Microsoft Excel. The project includes multiple interactive dashboards, charts, and tables designed to analyze and visualize store performance across various parameters.

It covers the complete Data Analysis process, including:
- Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data for accuracy.
